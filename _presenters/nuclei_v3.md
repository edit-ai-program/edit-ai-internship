abstract: Nuclei segmentation is a critical step in the analysis of histopathological images, serving as a foundation for various diagnostic and research applications in cancer studies. Accurate segmentation of nuclei enables the precise analysis of cell and tissue structures, which is essential for understanding the progression of diseases like cancer. Traditional methods to segment nuclei often utilize manual annotation or semi-automated techniques. However, these techniques can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, expensive, and prone to error. To address these issue, the development of more advanced segmentation models is crucial. Current deep-learning models take up large amounts of space and are resource-intensive during training and predicting. This study aims to develop a machine-learning model that is not resource-intensive but can provide accurate and automatic segmentation of nuclei in histopathological images. The resulting segmentation can aid patient prognosis, morphological analysis, and other areas of histopathological research.
summary: Nuclei segmentation is a computer-based method that helps doctors and researchers automatically identify and analyze the control center of cells in tissue samples. This process is essential for diagnosing diseases like cancer and studying cell behavior. This study aims to automate this process without using resource-intensive artificial intelligence models that take up lots of processing power.

**What was your favorite seminar? Why?**  

My favorite seminar was the one by Jason Wei at OpenAI. It was really interesting to hear from someone who had previous experience at Dartmouth and that worked with Dr. Levy. I also liked to hear about how he get into the field of machine learning and his recommendations of how to go about starting to learn machine learning, one of which I decided to pursue. It was cool to hear about large scale systems and computing. I was able to learn a lot about how things go on in large AI focused companies and some of the basics of NLP in widespread public use.

**If you were to summarize your summer internship experience in one sentence, what would it be?**  

One sentence to summarize my internship would be: When you get an opportunity and the resources to learn about something or solve an interesting problem, take it. I was very fortunate to be able to have access to high performance computing machines which helped me play around with some resource intensive models and ideas. I also was able to work with experienced mentors who helped guide me and recommended materials that were crucial in learning about how to go about solving my problem. I was able to learn a lot from this experience because I took advantage of the resources I had and I hope to keep in touch with the people I have met so I can learn more.

**Introduction**

The detection and segmentation of nuclei creates the basis for many
pathology image analyses. However, the manual process of segmenting
nuclei is expensive and time-consuming. Creating a machine learning
model can help pathologists save time and resources allowing for more
time for personalized treatment. Many machine learning models utilize
deep learning that takes up lots of space and resources. As a result,
our goal was to create a machine learning model that was not
resource-intensive but could still give fast and accurate predictions.

**Methodology**

When we started coming up with solutions, some of the things we found
and recommended were segmentation models like YOLOv8 and segmentation
architecture like SegNet. As a larger group, we split up and pursued
these solutions however we faced many errors and challenges in creating
and training a model from scratch and unclear results and errors while
training a pre-existing model. We decided to move away from more complex
deep learning algorithms to simpler machine learning algorithms using
computer vision, clustering algorithms, and threshold algorithms, to
create 2 solutions.

**Computer Vision Method**

For the computer vision approach, the model uses preprocessed images of
whole slide images (grayscaled and blurred to normalize most
differences) and uses adaptive thresholding to single out any small
clusters of pixels that have similar pixel intensities. Adaptive
thresholding helps single out clusters of a certain size by comparing a
pixel to its surroundings to determine if it is the foreground or
background. The nuclei size varies between images, and without manually
annotating each image, this method allows us to segment regions with a
different intensity than their surroundings and are not too large or
small. The model then removes any lighter clusters and extremely dark
ones to segment the nuclei. The reason we only want to keep dark
clusters and not anything else is because, throughout the data, whether
the images were darker or lighter, the nuclei were consistently one of
the darkest clusters in the image but not the darkest.

**K means Clustering**

Another way we were able to find results was by using K means clustering
on our data. K means clustering groups values into clusters by reducing
the difference within the clusters and maximizing the difference between
clusters. We followed the hypothesis that many nuclei in a whole slide
image were most likely to be some of the darkest pixels in the image. We
tested this hypothesis by taking the pixels that were part of the
darkest cluster. However, when we were able to look at the pixels it
obtained, many dark, and often relatively large, spots weren't nuclei.
We were able to filter out this undesirable data by creating code to
assign groups of pixels that made up each object, whether it was a
nucleus or something else. We then experimented with values that would
only select the smaller nuclei by taking the sizes of the groups. We
also found that linear fragments of cell membrane in an image could
sometimes be identified as nuclei, as they were darker colored. We were
able to mitigate these appearances by taking the standard deviation of
each group and selecting only those with smaller values. This ended up
returning mainly small, dark, objects that we considered
nuclei.![](media/image8.png){width="2.6875in"

**Accuracy**

To measure the accuracy of our computer vision method, we took our
ground truth: bounding boxes from our data set around each nucleus in
the whole slide images. We measured how much of our prediction
overlapped with the image mask. By repeating this process across the
entire data set, we were able to determine that this method had varying
accuracy from 70% when nuclei were very small to 80% when nuclei were
large and dark. We noticed that in cases where the accuracy was low or
when the nuclei were tiny, the model was better at predicting where the
nuclei were not rather than identifying them. One thing to keep in mind
is that the data set also places cells not just nuclei in the image
mask, so the mask is expected to contain things the predictions do not.

Measuring the accuracy of the k means method was done by using the same
bounding boxes that were provided in the dataset we acquired. Though
each bounding box seemed to cover a region that looked more like the
boundaries of a cell, rather than the smaller, darker nuclei. Each
bounding box was checked to see if a group was found in it, and that
included group was marked as correct. If that condition was not
satisfied, a false negative was reported. However, due to the variation
between the bounding boxes and nuclei, with multiple nuclei having the
possibility to be in one bounding box, this measure was inaccurate.
Similarly, we checked each group to see if it was within a bounding box
and that was also marked. If a group was not contained within a bounding
box, it was marked as a false positive. This ended up giving us an
accuracy of about 40%, with an AUC score of about 0.5. Seemingly, the
model seemed to predict with a better accuracy when comparing. Moreover,
many predicted nuclei lay just outside the bounding box, giving us more
false positives. Again, this low accuracy was most likely due to the
difference between the ground truth and model prediction.

**Reflection**

Some things that we found that didn't work that well for us was the use
of deep learning models whether training a pre-existing model or making
one from scratch. The main reason for this is that we tried to use
complex algorithms without having a mastery of the fundamentals of
machine learning. Because of this the switch to more basic methods was
very beneficial and was what worked the best. We were able to gain a
deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms. Overall, the models
we have created do a good job of identifying large and dark nuclei which
is an ideal image. More work can and should be done in the future so
that they can identify smaller nuclei and nuclei in lighter regions as
well. For this, a one-size-fits-all approach like the computer vision
model will not work and must be refined by either creating multiple
smaller models and combining all the results, or by using an approach
that recognizes that the nuclei do not always look the same an example
being deep learning models using annotated training data.

Here is an example of what the computer vision process looks like on a
specific training example

We can see that a lot of the missed areas are lighter regions with
smaller nuclei. Total Accuracy: 78.5%
