abstract: Choriocarcinoma is a rare and aggressive form of placenta cancer that presents significant challenges for early detection and diagnosis due to its ability to mimic common pregnancy-related issues. Accurate identification of chorionic villi, which are critical indicators of choriocarcinoma, is essential for effective diagnosis, but manual analysis of these tissues is both time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. In this study, we aimed to develop a comprehensive and well-annotated dataset of chorionic villi from high-resolution whole-slide images (WSIs) of products of conception (POC) tissue samples. Utilizing a hybrid approach that combined the Segment Anything Model (SAM), an AI-based segmentation tool, with manual verification and corrections, we successfully annotated approximately 4,000 villi. The annotation process revealed challenges related to the irregular and varied shapes of villi, which often required manual intervention despite the assistance of SAM. The resulting dataset offers a valuable resource for future research, particularly in the development of AI-driven diagnostic tools that can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of choriocarcinoma detection. This study highlights the need for further refinement of automated segmentation tools and establishes a foundation for ongoing advancements in the field of placental pathology.
summary: We worked on labeling different parts of a cell that may indicate a dangerous type of cancer related to pregnancy. These "annotations" help different models to be able to detect if a person has this type of cancer or other abnormalties.

**What was your favorite seminar? Why?**  

My favorite seminar was the one with Jason Wei because I also want to work at open AI and I was interested by his work. I was intersted by the projects that open AI is working on and made me really invested in this seminar.
