**About Me:**
Hi! I’m Afya Shaikh, a sophomore at Burlington High School. I’m really passionate about using AI and technology to make a difference in medicine, especially in areas like dermatology, oncology, and pathology. I love being part of clubs that let me explore programming, advocacy, and healthcare. I’m also the secretary of our Student Government, where I work to bring people together. I enjoy leading, inspiring others, and standing up for what I believe in. Art is another big part of my life—it’s how I express myself and raise awareness for causes I care about. When I’m not painting, I’m probably reading with a cozy blanket and a cup of hot cocoa.

**Project/Research Interests:**
Dermatology Computational Pathology Cancer Research Machine Learning and Engineering in Medical Applications
