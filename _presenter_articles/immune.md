abstract:  Understanding the spatial organization and interactions of immune cells is critical for advancing research in areas like autoimmune disorders and cancer immunotherapy. Traditional methods of analyzing immune cells are often difficult to detect. To address this issue, our project uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to detect immune cells in tissue samples. We utilize annotated whole slide images (WSIs), to accurately locate white blood cells within complex cell clusters. Our approach uses the contextual power of GNNs to identify these cells, offering a scalable and objective solution for immune cell analysis. The performance of our model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, with the goal of being able to detect immune cells in tissue samples. 
summary: We are developing an advanced computer model to automatically find and map immune cells, like white blood cells, in tissue samples, which could help doctors better understand and treat diseases like cancer. By using cutting-edge technology, our approach aims to make the analysis of these cells faster, more accurate, and easier to perform.

**What was your favorite seminar? Why?**  

my favorite seminar was the very first one since it gave us a very solid introduction into the program and set a tone for the rest of our internship
*-Sohan Arigela*

I enjoyed the first seminar because it showed me what I am getting into.

**If you were to summarize your summer internship experience in one sentence, what would it be?**  

A summer full of researching machine learning algorithms to address medical shortcomings
*-Sohan Arigela*

My summer internship experience was challenging because this was probably the most difficult research I have ever done, I came in with hopes of improving the previous usage of GNNs used in image analysis, but I soon realized how difficult it really was and ended up coming short of my goals.

**Understanding the Complexity of Immune Cells**
>
The immune system, with its diverse cell types and intricate
interactions, is essential in\
defending the body against diseases. White blood cells, among the most
critical components of this system, play a key role in identifying and
neutralizing threats. However, the complexity of these cells\' spatial
organization within tissues has long posed challenges for researchers.
Traditional methods for analyzing immune cells involve manual
examination of tissue samples, a process that is both time-consuming
and susceptible to human error. As the need for precision in
understanding diseases like cancer grows, so does the demand for more
advanced tools that can provide deeper insights into immune cell
behavior.
>
**The Need for Advanced Automation in Immune Cell Analysis**
>
Accurate identification and mapping of immune cells in tissue samples
are vital for advancing research in areas like immunotherapy,
autoimmune disorders, and cancer diagnostics. However, the manual
analysis of these cells is labor-intensive and often inconsistent,
which can hinder the scalability of research and clinical
applications. As a result, there is a pressing need for automated,
objective, and scalable methods that can improve the reliability and
speed of immune cell analysis.
>
**Our Approach: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Immune Cell
Identification**
>
To address these challenges, our project focuses on developing a deep
learning algorithm using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to accurately
and efficiently identify immune cells within tissue samples. Unlike
other approaches that may rely on multiple technologies such as
Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), or frameworks like Detectron2, our method utilizes only GNNs.
This decision is based on the unique ability of
>
GNNs to model the complex relationships between cells in a spatial
context, making them particularly well-suited for this task.
>
The core idea is to treat each cell as a node in a graph, with edges
representing the spatial or contextual relationships between these
cells. By analyzing these graphs, GNNs can capture the intricate
patterns and interactions within immune cell clusters, leading to more
accurate identification of specific cell types, such as white blood
cells.
>
**Data Collection: Building a Robust Dataset**
>
Our work is grounded in a comprehensive dataset drawn from 36 patients
with Stage-pT3 colorectal cancer, collected at Dartmouth-Hitchcock
Medical Center between 2016 and 2019.
>
These samples were meticulously prepared and scanned into
high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs), which were then subdivided
into tens of thousands of smaller images. This extensive dataset
allows our GNN model to be trained on a wide variety of examples,
enhancing its ability to generalize across different tissue samples
and improving its accuracy in identifying immune cells.
>
**Evaluating the Performance of GNNs**
>
To measure the effectiveness of our GNN-based approach, we use a
variety of performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), and Intersection
Over Union (IOU). These metrics provide a comprehensive view of how
well our model performs in identifying immune cells, allowing us to
identify strengths and areas for improvement. By focusing on these
metrics, we aim to ensure that our model not only works well in
controlled settings but also has the potential to be applied in
real-world clinical and research environments.
>
**Overcoming Challenges and Moving Forward**
>
One of the significant challenges we face is ensuring that our GNN
model is both accurate and efficient, particularly given the
complexity of the data and the time constraints associated with our
research. However, by focusing on a single, specialized
technology---GNNs---we believe we can create a model that is not only
powerful but also easier to refine and optimize. Our ultimate goal is
to develop a prototype that can serve as a foundation for future
research, providing a reliable tool for scientists and clinicians
working on immune cell analysis.
>
**Deliverables: Sharing Our Insights and Tools**
>
Our project will culminate in the creation of a prototype simulation
of our GNN-based model, along with a detailed blog post documenting
our research journey and findings. Additionally, we will develop a
user-friendly interface that allows others to explore and test our
model. These deliverables are designed to make our work accessible to
a broad audience, from researchers and clinicians to anyone interested
in the cutting-edge of medical imaging technology.
>
**Conclusion: Pioneering New Frontiers in Immune Cell Analysis**
>
Our project represents a significant advancement in the automation of
immune cell analysis. By leveraging the unique strengths of Graph
Neural Networks, we aim to create a tool that not only speeds up the
analysis process but also enhances its accuracy and reliability. As we
continue to refine our model, we hope that our work will contribute to
a deeper understanding of immune responses and improve the diagnosis
and treatment of diseases, particularly in the field of cancer
research and immunotherapy.
